### Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this project I build 2 modules that can be used to get asset volatility predictions.

The first module is a class to get data from web API by making HTTP requests, transform the data then load it into an SQLite database.

The second module is a Garch Model class that can be used to model the data for a chosen ticker symbol and then make prediction.

I have also built a server which will serve predictions for the chosen ticker symbol.
